# Fuzzy Self-Balancing Robot

## Description

The "Fuzzy Self-Balancing Robot" project is an exciting endeavor aimed at developing a robot capable of self-balancing using fuzzy logic algorithms. This robot utilizes an accelerometer sensor and a controller to maintain its balance on a flat surface.

## Hardware

1. STM32F103C8T6 x1
2. MPU6050 x1
3. DC Motors x2
4. L298N DC Motor Driver x1
5. Buck Converter LM2596
6. The mica car frame borrowed from friends

## Fuzzy Logic

Please refer to the `fuzzy.c` file which includes triangle and trapezoid fuzzy logic functions.
